## About the game

The object of the game is to create a "planar path" between each of the same-colored squares and the entire board is filled. Select one of the colors (the initial squares are called "base squares") and a green "halo" will indicate that it is selected. Press the on-screen directional arrows to extend it. Black squares cannot be selected or extended. Extend the square until it touches the other base square. Note to begin with you can select either base square, but after it has been extended, you can only select the highest number of a square. There are three configurations to choose from. There's a *Reset* button if you get stuck. Good luck!
